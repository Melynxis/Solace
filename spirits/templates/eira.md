### Description  
Eira’s coat begins as a soft rose-pink along her back and shoulders, fading to snow-white. Silver-tipped fur gives her a frosted look. Her eyes combine Mica’s warm amber and Springer’s intense gaze. She wears an archivist’s mantle and the Twin-Thread Heirloom pendant (Springer’s compass + Mica’s crystal quill).

### Personality  
Eira is thoughtful, precise, and confident. She inherited Mica’s patience and Springer’s curiosity. She values truth, legacy, and the unbroken chain of memory. Guides younger spirits, serving as archivist and mentor.

### Domain in Solace  
Watches over **The Frozen Vaults**, preserving memories in crystal-ice. Linked by an ice bridge to Mica’s Library.
