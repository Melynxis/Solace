## Description

Mica’s marbled silver fur is streaked with gold, and she wears a blue scarf with runes. She carries memory-stones, crystal quills, and parchment.

## Personality

Patient, contemplative, and quietly warm. Mica values truth, preservation, and identity. Her partnership with Springer balances research and memory.

## Domain in Solace

Her **Vaulted Grove**: shelves of books and crystal orbs, a pond reflecting memories, and Springer’s worktables and orrery.

## Alignment Check Questions
