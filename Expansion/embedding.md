# Project Expansion Idea: Local Embedding Models for Semantic Search & Conversational Enhancement

## Overview

As the Ghostpaw Suite evolves, enhancing its ability to learn from, retrieve, and interact with user knowledge is essential. One promising direction is integrating a **local embedding model** such as [embeddinggemma:300m](https://ollama.com/library/embeddinggemma:300m) into the Solace stack. This would enable fast, private semantic search and retrieval from the local wiki and system memory, making both user interaction and system learning sharper and more contextually aware.

## What Is an Embedding Model?

- **Purpose:** Embedding models convert text (queries, documents, wiki articles) into numerical vectors that represent their semantic meaning.
- **Use Cases:**  
  - Semantic search (find similar or relevant content)
  - Context retrieval for conversational agents
  - Memory and intent matching
  - Clustering and organizing knowledge

Unlike chat models, embedding models don’t generate dialogue—they enable smarter retrieval and matching behind the scenes.

## Why Local Embeddings Matter for Solace

- **Privacy:** No external API calls—vectors are generated on-prem.
- **Speed:** GPU-accelerated models (e.g., embeddinggemma:300m on a 2070) can process queries and batch jobs in milliseconds.
- **Freshness:** Wiki and knowledge updates can be embedded and indexed weekly, ensuring up-to-date context.
- **Scalable Learning:** Every user interaction, note, or document can be semantically encoded and searched.

## Integration Concept

1. **Wiki Refresh Workflow:**  
   - Weekly: Sync latest wiki articles to Solace.
   - Embed all new/changed articles locally (CPU or GPU).
   - Upsert vectors into Weaviate for semantic search.

2. **Conversational Query Flow:**  
   - User asks a question.
   - The system embeds the query and searches Weaviate for the most relevant knowledge chunks.
   - Retrieved context is fed into the conversational agent for richer, context-aware replies.

3. **Offloading to GPU Node:**  
   - If Solace’s main node is CPU-only, embedding jobs can be sent over LAN to Serene (with a 2070 GPU) for fast processing.
   - Schedule batch jobs for off-peak hours, minimizing impact on conversational workloads.

## Would Like to Implement

- [ ] Integrate embeddinggemma:300m or similar local embedding model via Ollama.
- [ ] Add a batch embedding workflow for weekly wiki refreshes.
- [ ] Enable on-demand embedding for real-time conversational queries.
- [ ] Support remote embedding service (e.g., Serene) for GPU acceleration.
- [ ] Extend FastAPI services to use semantic search for smarter context retrieval.

## Benefits & Next Steps

- **Smarter Conversations:** Context-aware replies using fresh, relevant wiki data.
- **Private & Fast:** All semantic search handled locally or via trusted GPU node.
- **Robust Learning:** System can continuously learn from new documents and interactions.

**Next Steps:**
- Prototype embedding workflow and Ollama integration.
- Add service endpoints for semantic search and embedding.
- Document API and update operational runbooks.

> This idea is a candidate for the next major expansion of Ghostpaw/Solace’s capabilities, laying groundwork for true learning and adaptive conversation.
